## Trigger

To create a trigger you'll need to have binds for melee/fire/smoke/grenade and use.
Bindings for saving a trigger can be found in the multiplayer control menu.

```
Melee: Create a trigger.
Use: Increase width.
Grenade: Increase height.
Smoke: Enable collision.
```

Once you saved the trigger, the generated script can be found in **sr_dev/games_mp.log**.

## Spawn

To get the position of your spawn, make sure you are in standing position, use **/centerview** and **/viewpos** in the console then open the console ``shift + console key`` and get the position line.
